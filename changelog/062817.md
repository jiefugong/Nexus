## Changelog

Progress Updates:
- Near completion of Reddit module
- Entries completed and React component created
- Page successfully cycles through loaded data from scraping of subscribed Subreddits

### Plan
There are a few suboptimal parts of the current design. For one, the React component takes in as props the entirety of the web scraped data. This is actually a lot, so if we stick with this approach we need to limit the results passed in during the Rails backend calls or figure out a better way to link the React components with the database (so that we don't have to pass in the entirety of the data as `props`).

There are a few more features to add before this module can be called complete:
- There is still an issue with styling, as the buttons for cycling through the subreddits are not fully and correctly linked to Bootstrap styling
- We need to check that our database is actually being cleared properly on each reload of the page so we don't burn out our disk space
- We still need options to add and remove subreddits

Overall pretty satisfied with the progress that has been made :)
