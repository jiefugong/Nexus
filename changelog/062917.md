## Changelog
More progress has been made on the Reddit module. It is now capable of sorting by score and has the links sorted out between text and photo related content. There are a few concerns I'll lay down before as the new completion of this module begets the next one, which I have decided to be a Calendar integration.

### Plan
There is still no feature to delete or add subreddits that we are subscribed to. Initially I wanted to make this inline, but for stylistic purposes and to expand the design of this project I have decided to create a separate Settings page that will feature custom React setting components for each module.

The one for Reddit shall include:
- List of all currently subscribed subreddits (with an inline styling element to destroy that element)
- Form to submit the addition of a new Subreddit to subscribe to
- Logic to enforce a currently arbitrary maximum amount of Subreddit subscriptions for stylistic purposes
- Information displaying the current maximum amount of entries allowed, so on and so forth
