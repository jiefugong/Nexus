## Changelog

Progress Updates:
- Began construction of Reddit module
- Models for `Entry` and `Subreddit` constructed to allow module to discern what subreddits to scrape and how to save the information
- View displays initial subreddit and logs all entries from all subreddits to scrape

### Plan
A few changes must be made to existing features and careful attention must be paid to the structure of the submodule.

Firstly, changes should be made to display only the top 5 links from each subreddit (as even 10 is too many for a short Reddit digest). We should also scrape for score and pay attention to separating links to the discussion thread and the content (as there are cases where only one may exist)

The next step should be to create a React component that allows the display for the Reddit module to automatically update depending on the active Reddit selected. Because the initial scraping processes and updates each subreddit, we need to figure out how to connect the data in the React component to the model used to represent the saved scraped data. Thus, when the buttons representing the various subreddits are clicked, the active subreddit changes and what populates the table changes as well.

Once is done there are a few optimizations we can consider:
- Optimize scraping to not actually collect information from the entirety of the subreddit (scrape the first 10 links somehow)

### React Component
We will use a React component to display the entries to the subreddit scraping. The React component will carry state regarding the current entries to expose, and a function that will alter that state based on which of the buttons below was clicked.
