### Plan
The next module to be implemented is the notes module, to facilitate for the fact that I currently have too many unorganized thoughts that I need to save. The notes module should have the following features:

- Create topics (as a row of tabs) to be displayed somewhere in the module where each tab is a topic. When the tab is clicked, it displays all created notes for that topic. When that note is clicked, a text area expands in some form displaying the notes that have been taken. An edit button is provided to allow the note to be edited.
- Can initially start with no topics, just an unorganized collection of notes by their title. Format should still be a box with rows displaying the saved notes. Should it be another table?
